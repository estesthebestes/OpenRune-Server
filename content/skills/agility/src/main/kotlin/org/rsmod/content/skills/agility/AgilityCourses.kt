 * One linked movement of an obstacle. Live builds a crossing out of three of these - climb on,

 * `monkeybars_off`.
 *
 * A null [landing] keeps the player still, which is what a mount and a dismount do. [ticks] of 0
 * means "however long the distance takes" at one tile per tick, so a traverse keeps pace with its
 * own looping animation instead of gliding across ahead of the player's feet.
 *
 * [moveTicks] separates the travelling from the animation. A jump is airborne for a moment and then
 * spends the rest of its animation landing, so the movement has to finish early or the player keeps
 * drifting after they have already come down.
 *
 * [perTile] is how many ticks one tile of a traverse takes, and it has to be the length of the
 * animation's own loop or the feet and the ground disagree. Monkeybars loop in one tick and a log
 * balance takes two, which is why a tightrope walked at a monkeybar's pace looks like skating.
